## How It Works

1. **Game Start**: When you run the game, MyWorld is created, which extends MenuWorld and displays the main menu
2. **Game Selection**: Click on any of the three game buttons to start that game
3. **Playing Games**: 
   - Basketball is fully playable with all original features
   - Volleyball and Badminton show placeholder screens
4. **Return to Menu**: Press ESC key in any game to return to the main menu
